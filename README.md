#Horiseon Starer Code Refactor and Accessibilty Edit


User Story: As a developer, I was giving the task by a marketing agency Horison to refactor the starter code and apply accessibilty to their website. When viewing the source code I was able to to find the semantic HTML elements that structure logically independent of styling and positioning. With VS code I was able to edit the HTML elements to complete the request. To make their website more assessable I changed the div to section in the HTML. I Added a description to all images for the reader using alt attributes and icon to the icon buttons.


* Refactor code
* Add accessibilty to website/application
